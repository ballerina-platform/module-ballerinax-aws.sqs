# Examples

The `ballerinax/aws.sqs` connector provides practical examples illustrating usage in various scenarios. Explore these [examples](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-aws.sqs/tree/master/examples):

1. [**Basic Queue Consumer**](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-aws.sqs/tree/master/examples/basic-queue-consumer) – Demonstrates creating a standard SQS queue, sending messages, and consuming them using a Ballerina listener.
2. [**Basic Queue Operations**](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-aws.sqs/tree/master/examples/basic-queue-operations) – Shows how to create a queue, send, receive, and delete messages, and delete the queue.
3. [**Advanced Messaging Features**](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-aws.sqs/tree/master/examples/advanced-messaging-features) – Demonstrates advanced messaging features such as message attributes, batch sending, and custom queue attributes.
4. [**FIFO Queue**](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-aws.sqs/tree/master/examples/fifo-queue) – Shows how to work with FIFO queues, including sending messages with different `messageGroupId`s and grouping received messages.

## Prerequisites

1. AWS Account with SQS access.
2. For each example, create a `Config.toml` file with your AWS credentials and queue details. Here’s an example:

```toml
# Standard queue name
queueName = "ballerina-example-queue"

# FIFO queue name (must end with .fifo)
fifoQueueName = "ballerina-example-queue.fifo"

# AWS credentials
accessKeyId = "<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>"
secretAccessKey = "<YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>"

# Queue URL
queueUrl = "<YOUR_QUEUE_URL>"
```

## Running an example

Execute the following commands to build an example from the source:

* To build an example:

    ```bash
    bal build
    ```

* To run an example:

    ```bash
    bal run
    ```

## Building the examples with the local module

**Warning**: Due to the absence of support for reading local repositories for single Ballerina files, the Bala of the module is manually written to the central repository as a workaround. Consequently, the bash script may modify your local Ballerina repositories.

Execute the following commands to build all the examples against the changes you have made to the module locally:

* To build all the examples:

    ```bash
    ./build.sh build
    ```

* To run all the examples:

    ```bash
    ./build.sh run
